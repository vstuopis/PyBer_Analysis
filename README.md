# PyBer_Analysis

## Ride-Sharing Data by City Type

### Overview
We wanted to review the impact the different city types had on the health of PyBer. As part of this analysis we broke down each location into 3 city types, Urban, Suburban or Rural. We wanted to better understand the customers from the areas, if there are any opportunities for growth, or potentially find areas for strategic change.  

### Results
- Total Rides by City Type: 1625 (Urban), 625 (Suburban), 125 (Rural)
- Total Drivers by City Type: 2405 (Urban), 490 (Suburban), 78 (Rural)
- Total Fares by City Type: $39854.38 (Urban), $19,356.33 (Suburban), $4327.93 (Rural)
- Average Fare per ride: $24.52 (Urban), $30.97 (Suburban), $34.62 (Rural)
- Average Fare per driver: $16.57 (Urban), $39.50 (Suburban), $55.49 (Rural)
- Total Fare by City Type: $39,854.38 (Urban), $19,356.33 (Suburban), $4327.93 (Rural)

### Summary

Based on the observations and analysis of the current ride-sharing data there are 3 recommendations we propose.
1. If possible, it would be good to relocate some of the urban drivers into Suburban or Rural areas as there were more drivers than rides in the Urban areas.
2. We recommend gathering data on trip length as this would allow us to better understand our markets and see if we can identify any trends when it comes to the length of the ride comapred to the cost of the ride.
3. We propose increasing our marketing in Urban areas to continue to drive growth as this area currently has the highest total rides and makes up over 62% of our total fares from all city types.
